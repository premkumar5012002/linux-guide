# History of Linux

## UNIX

It all begins in AT&T Corporation's Bell Laboratories where **Dennis Ritchie**, **Ken Thompson** and other’s created new operating system called **UNIX**.
The development of Unix started at **1969** and publicly announced in **1973**.

UNIX Operating system originally written in assembly language and soon rewritten C programming language for its Portability and readability.

Soon UNIX become popular operating system at academic circles.

## GNU Project

GNU stands for “**GNU's Not Unix**.” is developed by **Richard Stallman.** GNU is collection of free software that can be used as an operating system
or can be used in parts with other operating systems such as **UNIX**.

The inspiration for GNU was started when Richard Stallman was working in MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and printer there was getting jammed and
Richard Stallman wrote a program that notices them when it happens. When the new model printer from Xerox was purchased, Richard tries do the same
but failed because source code for printer was not available to public. When Richard emailed for source code later Xerox rejected his request.
Then Richard Stallman Started working on GNU Project with aims to bring free software for everybody who wants it view, modify or distribute the program or its source code.
Later Richard Stallman quits his job at MIT to fully focus on development of GNU project.

GNU project meant to provide software's that run in UNIX like system’s or independently using **GNU Hurd Kernel**.

GNU project gives birth to most important software’s such as

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- GNU Core Utilities
- GNU Bash Shell
- GNU Emacs

## Linux kernel

Linus Torvalds was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in the early 1990s. he wanted to understand how operating system worked at a low level.
He began experimenting and developing his own kernel as a hobby project.

Linus initially used Minix, a Unix-like operating system developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, to understand operating system concepts. However, he found Minix to be limited in terms of
functionality and scalability. This motivated him to create a kernel that would be more robust, flexible, and suitable for his purposes.

In September 1991, Linus released the first version of the Linux kernel on the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server of
the Finnish University and Research Network (FUNET).

Linux itself is not complete operating system it is just kernel that interactions between hardware and software components. To make it complete operating system you need software packages
that users wanted to use.

## GNU / Linux

Only way to run GNU project independently without any other operating system is to use **GNU Hurd**.
GNU Hurd is the kernel component of the GNU operating system. It is a microkernel-based kernel designed by the GNU Project.

When Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel in 1991, it was already functional and usable. Linux quickly gained momentum and attracted a
large community of developers who contributed to its growth and improvement.In contrast, the development of GNU Hurd progressed more slowly,
and it was not as mature or widely supported as Linux.

As the development of the Linux kernel progressed, it became clear that combining the Linux kernel with the existing GNU software
could result in a complete and functional operating system. The Linux kernel was licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
which aligned with the GNU Project's philosophy of free software.

The integration of the Linux kernel with the GNU software led to the emergence of GNU/Linux distributions.
These distributions combined the Linux kernel with the GNU tools, libraries, and utilities to create a fully functional operating system.
Distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and others gained popularity, providing users with a complete and customizable GNU/Linux experience.

Technially Linux should called as GNU / Linux not just Linux. because operating system uses GNU software's to make it as complete operating system
experience.
