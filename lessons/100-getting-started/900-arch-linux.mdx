<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>
  Arch is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution driven 100% by the
  community. Similar to Debian, Arch uses a rolling release model so incremental
  updates eventually become the Stable release. You really need to get your
  hands dirty to understand the system and its functions, but in turn you get
  complete and total control of your system.
</p>

<h5>Package Management</h5>
<p>
  It uses its own package manager, Pacman, to install, update and manage
  packages.
</p>

<h5>Configurability</h5>
<p>
  If you want a lightweight operating system and really want to understand Linux
  use Arch! There’s a bit of a learning curve, but for the hardcore Linux users,
  this is a great choice.
</p>

<h5>Uses</h5>
<p>
  Great for desktop and laptop. If you also have a small device such as a
  Raspberry Pi and need to stick a lightweight OS on it, you can’t go wrong with
  Arch.
