<h5>Overview</h5>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux commonly referred to as RHEL is developed by Red Hat. RHEL
has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still provides source
code for free.

<h5>Package Management</h5>
RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, RPM package manager, which we
will eventually learn about as well.

<h5>Configurability</h5>
RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from the Debian-based operating
systems, most noticeably in package management. If you decide to go with RHEL it’s
probably best if you know you’ll be working with it.

<h5>Uses</h5>
As described by the name it's mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a solid server
OS this would be a good one.
