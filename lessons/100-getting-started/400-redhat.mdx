<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux commonly referred to as RHEL is developed by Red Hat.
  RHEL has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still
  provides source code for free.
</p>

<h5>Package Management</h5>
<p>
  RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, RPM package manager, which
  we will eventually learn about as well.
</p>

<h5>Configurability</h5>
<p>
  RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from the Debian-based
  operating systems, most noticeably in package management. If you decide to go
  with RHEL it’s probably best if you know you’ll be working with it.
</p>

<h5>Uses</h5>
<p>
  As described by the name it's mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a
  solid server OS this would be a good one.
