##### Overview

Gentoo offers ridiculous flexibility with the operating system at a price. It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind
getting their hands dirty with the system.

##### Package Management

Gentoo uses its own package management, Portage. The Portage package management is very modular and easy to maintain,
which plays a big part in the operating system as a whole being very flexible.

##### Configurability

If you’re just getting started with Linux and want to take a more difficult path, I’d choose Gentoo or Arch Linux as
your distribution.

##### Uses

Great for desktop and laptop.
