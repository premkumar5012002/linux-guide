<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>
  Gentoo offers ridiculous flexibility with the operating system at a price.
  It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind getting their hands dirty with the
  system.
</p>

<h5>Package Management</h5>
<p>
  Gentoo uses its own package management, Portage. The Portage package
  management is very modular and easy to maintain, which plays a big part in the
  operating system as a whole being very flexible.
</p>

<h5>Configurability</h5>
<p>
  If you’re just getting started with Linux and want to take a more difficult
  path, I’d choose Gentoo or Arch Linux as your distribution.
</p>

<h5>Uses</h5>
<p>Great for desktop and laptop.</p>
