<h5>Overview</h5>
Gentoo offers ridiculous flexibility with the operating system at a price. It’s made
for advanced users who don’t mind getting their hands dirty with the system.

<h5>Package Management</h5>
Gentoo uses its own package management, Portage. The Portage package management is
very modular and easy to maintain, which plays a big part in the operating system
as a whole being very flexible.

<h5>Configurability</h5>
If you’re just getting started with Linux and want to take a more difficult path,
I’d choose Gentoo or Arch Linux as your distribution.

<h5>Uses</h5>
Great for desktop and laptop.
